[I] Info

Hello, and thank you for downloading Pokemon Uranium 1.0!
We have put a lot of work into this game and we hope you enjoy playing it.
We started working on Pokemon Uranium more than 9 years ago.
We never dreamed that it would come this far or become this successful.
Pokemon Uranium is inspired by the love we have for the Pokemon franchise.
We wanted to create a tribute to the series we have loved since we were very young.
Hopefully you will play this game and feel the same joy we felt the first time playing a new Pokemon game.

The Uranium Team is not affiliated with Game Freak or Nintendo.
This is a free fan-made project. We aren't seeking to profit from it in any way.
Please continue to support the official Pokemon Games!

For comments, questions, and feedback, join the Pokemon Uranium Official Forums:

We hope you have a fantastic adventure!

~JV, Twitch & The Uranium Team



[II] Uranium 1.0 Contents

Version 1.0 is a COMPLETE version of the game. It contains all 8 Gyms, the Championship, the entire main storyline, as well as several post-game quests.

The updated Tandor Dex has a total of 200 Pokemon.
Of these, 192 are obtainable, and 8 more are coming in future updates.
For stats, movesets, evolution info, etc. you can check our Wiki, which will be updated with new info in the days following the game's initial release:

http://pokemon-uranium.wikia.com/wiki/Tandor_Pokedex

Pokemon Uranium 1.0's other contents include:

-13 Towns & Cities
-8 Gyms
-7 Optional Sidequests

-Transfer Pokemon from v4.3 Save Files
  (If you have a save file from a previous version of the game, you can transfer your old Pokemon into Uranium 1.0.
   Simply load up a preexisting save file in Uranium 1.0 and you will be asked if you want to transfer.
   Select "Yes" and you will begin a new game with the same Trainer ID# and Online ID as before.
   Your old Pokemon will be transfered to the Pokemon Storage System.
   This process can only be done once.)

-Online Lobby
  (You can battle and trade directly with other players online!
   Talk to the rightmost NPC in the top floor of the Pokemon Center to access the Online Lobby.
   Then, enter your friend's Online ID at the top.
   When you are both online, the button by their name will light up.
   You can click on their name to send battle and trade requests.)

-Player-vs-Player battles
  (In the online lobby, you can challenge another player who is online.
   There are three battle modes: Singles, Doubles, and VGC.

   SINGLE BATTLES: Up to 6 Pokemon can be used in a one-on-one match.
   DOUBLE BATTLES: Up to 6 Pokemon can be used in a two-on-two match.
   VGC BATTLES: Based on the Pokemon VGC Championship format, select 4 Pokemon out of 6 to battle in a 2-on-2 match.)

-Direct Trading
  (In the online lobby, you can send a trade request to another player who is online.
   When they accept the request, you will be brought to a screen that shows both of your teams.
   Select one of your Pokemon to offer to trade, and they will do the same.
   Choose "yes" to confirm, and the trade will go through.
   After the trade is completed you will be returned to the Online Lobby.)

-Mega Evolution
  (To unlock Mega Evolution, you need to beat the 7th gym)

-Virtual Trainer Battle
  (You can access Virtual Trainer from the centermost NPC on the top floor of any Pokemon Center.
   Create a virtual copy of your Pokemon team and battle other players' teams!)

-Global Trade Station
  (Talk to the left NPC in the top floor of any Pokemon Center to access the GTS.
   Like the GTS in official licensed Pokemon games, you can trade with other Pokemon Uranium players.
   Deposit a Pokemon to trade or search for the one you want.)

-Wonder Trade
  (You can send a Pokemon out and get a random one in return. It could be useless, or it could be
   super powerful!)

-Mystery Gift
  (From the main menu, choose "Mystery Gift".
   This is a Pokemon that the Uranium Team has made available to all players.
   It will help you on your adventure!)

-Nuzlocke Mode
  (When starting a new save file, you can elect to play in Nuzlocke Mode.
   This is a high-stakes mode where Pokemon cannot revive after fainting,
   and only one Pokemon can be captured per route.
   There are extra customization features in Nuzlocke Mode which can be toggled in the Options Menu.
   "Dubious Clause" allows you to ignore duplicate Pokemon encounters.
   "Healing in Battle" allows you to disallow use of items on Pokemon mid-battle.
   "Challenge Mode" raises the average level of enemy trainers' Pokemon, but not their experience.)

-Multiple Saves
  (Uranium allows for each player to have multiple save files.
   Simply choose to start a new game from the main menu and it will save into a new slot.
   There is no limit to the number of saves you can have!)

-External Patcher
  (Included in the folder with your Pokemon Uranium download is a program called Patcher.exe.
   This is used to install bug fixes and new updates to the game.
   Simply double-click on the file to open it. It will automatically search for and install new updates for the game.
   



[III] Bugs
